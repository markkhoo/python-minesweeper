# python-minesweeper

## Description
This is the Minesweeper game playable on the python console. This is the project I worked on to learn Python.

## Installation 
Either fork this repository or download `MineSweeper.py` directly. To play the game, run `MineSweeper.py` on your Python terminal and enter your inputs in that terminal.

## To-Do
* Resolve the bug where, when a coordinate is selected, sometimes nothing occurs. (Currently can not figure out why this is the case).
* Add a Flag feature `'F'` to put on coordinates to indicate a bomb.
    * When `'F'` is on the map, prevent "accidental" selection of that coordinate.
    * Adding a `'F'` on the map where one already exists removes the flag feature.
* Redo how minimum and maximum number of bombs work given the map size.
